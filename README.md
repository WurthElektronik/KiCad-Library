## Introduction
KiCad is a free and open-source software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). It facilitates the design and simulation of electronic hardware. It features an integrated environment for schematic capture, PCB layout, manufacturing file viewing, SPICE simulation, and engineering calculation. Tools exist within the package to create bill of materials, artwork, Gerber files, and 3D models of the PCB and its components.

[Würth Elektronik](https://www.we-online.com/) has a growing portfolio of models available for use in KiCad. These models allow KiCad users to easily design schematic and layout and view 3D model before producing PCB.

For how to use models in GitHub repository, you can refer to the help document in this folder.
